# foodsaving frontend

Welcome to the foodsaving tool frontend repository! This is the browser-side software that powers [foodsaving worldwide](foodsaving.world).


## yunity and foodsaving

The foodsaving tool is a project of [yunity](yunity.org). 
The [foodsaving worldwide team](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FSINT/) within yunity provides additional resources to build up foodsaving.
At a later point, more features could be added that support the yunity vision and mission, e.g. multi-sharing communities, item pooling, integrated decision making (syscon).

## Development goals

Our current development goals are prioritized and written down in our [elaborate roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

We are keeping the features down to a minimum (check out [that meeting's notes](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/2016-09-13+-+Narrowing+down+features)), in order to progressively build up a useful tool.

## Releases

Look into our [change log file](CHANGELOG.md) for a quick overview of past versions and recent changes.

### Potential users
In future, we want our feature requests to come directly from foodsaving communities, to fulfill their needs and desires.

We don't have testing communities yet: we are in touch with [existing foodsaving networks](https://yunity.atlassian.net/wiki/display/YUN/Existing+initiatives) who have shown interest in testing the tool once it presents sufficient features for them.

## Translation

We are using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) to provide the foodsaving tool in many languages. To help us with translation, please [create an account](http://transifex.com/signup) and [apply for foodsaving tool group](https://www.transifex.com/yunity-1/foodsaving-tool/frontend/).

After selecting your destination language and choosing the resource file, go ahead to start translating!
